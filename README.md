# Date Idea Generator

This is a simple command line application which spits out date ideas.

## Instalation

```
npm install date-ideas -g
```

## Usage

```
>user$ date-ideas
>Go swimming.
```

## Contributing

+ Clone the project
+ Take a look at index.js. Right now everything happens in there
+ Try to implement some of the goals. 
	+ Biggest/easiest way to contribute right now is submitting date ideas by adding rows to the Idea table in the sqlite `ideas.db` database.

## Goals

+ Add filter commands to the goals
	+ For example, since the app uses a sqlite database, it could filter by price, or types of dates
+ Add commands to see lists of ideas instead of just one 
+ Add many more ideas
